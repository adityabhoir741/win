             <p>Tyrion is a highly intelligent man who recognized from an early age that his mind was his greatest weapon, due to being born a member of House Lannister with the expectation of upholding his family's noble name, yet lacking the physical attributes possessed by his older siblings. Thus, he has committed himself to possessing a sharp intellect in order to help make up for his dwarfism, and he is frequently able to use his superior intellect to get the better of those who initially look down upon him or weasel his way out of tight situations, though he is not above resorting to using his family name and enormous fortune to bolster his position.
             </p>
             <p>Tyrion's mother, Joanna Lannister, died giving birth to him, a tragedy which 
                <a href="tywin.html" target="_blank" >Tywin</a> 
                and <a href="cersie.html" target="_blank">Cersei</a> unfairly blame Tyrion for.
                Tyrion is mocked for being a dwarf, called derisive names such as "Imp" and "Halfman", which he tries to embrace to keep his self esteem up. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion been born a commoner, he'd have been left in the woods to die; luckily, his birthright as a Lannister afforded him significant wealth and power.
             </p>
             <p>
             Only Tyrion's older brother <a href="jamie.html" target="_blank">Jamie</a> maintained a good relationship with Tyrion, admiring him for both his intellect and inability to let his diminished stature drag him down, and he has frequently attempted to come to Tyrion's defense when his other family members treat him maliciously, making Jaime the only member of his immediate family whom Tyrion loves.
             </p>
             <p>Tyrion's skills with political maneuvering, administration, and diplomacy are extremely impressive.Tyrion is somewhat of a pacifist in his heart. He always desires a less violent approach to matters, only resorting for it when there is no other way.
